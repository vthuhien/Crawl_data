## Here is the information about 2 project that I posed
### 1. Crawl Data
* In this project, we access a website about the data of the high school graduation exam scores (but I lost the link to website).
* After crawling this web, we start computing, cleaning to get the preprocessed data and transfer to a csv [file](https://github.com/vthuhien/Crawl_data/blob/master/Crawl_data/data_clean.csv).
* Finish, we analyze this data by some [charts](https://github.com/vthuhien/Crawl_data/blob/master/Crawl_data/README.md) to show insights from them.

### 2. Get data from API and HTML
* In this project, we will show you how to scrape data from a website that is created by HTML and supported by some other languages.
* This dataset is obtained from this website: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:COVID-19_pandemic_data#covid-19-pandemic-data
* Furthermore, we also indicate the way to get format data from an API link
* [Here's](https://github.com/vthuhien/Crawl_data/blob/master/Get-data-from-API-and-HTML/README.md) more information about this
